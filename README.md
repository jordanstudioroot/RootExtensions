# RootExtensions

A library of C# extension methods for Unity classes used by Studio Root Games. Can be directly copied into a project, turned into a Unity Package Manager package, or imported into the project as an NPM package using `npm install jordanstudioroot/UnityNPMInit`, in which case it will be copied to `Assets/RootExtensions`.

# Requirements
